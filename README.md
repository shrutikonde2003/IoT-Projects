“Introductory IoT penetration testing project using TryHackMe's virtual lab environment.”

IoT Pentesting – Introductory Project (TryHackMe)



📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my first hands-on IoT (Internet of Things) penetration testing project completed through the TryHackMe platform. The objective of this project was to gain practical experience in identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities in IoT devices and networks.



The focus was on learning about security risks associated with connected devices, using realistic virtual environments to simulate attacks and defenses.

&nbsp;🛠 Tools \& Technologies Used



✔ TryHackMe – Intro to IoT Pentesting Lab  

✔ Virtual Attack Box – provided by TryHackMe for safe testing  

✔ Nmap – network scanning and enumeration  

✔ Metasploit Framework – exploitation and payload delivery  

✔ Wireshark – packet capture and traffic analysis  

✔ OpenVAS (optional) – vulnerability scanning  

✔ Linux command-line tools for reconnaissance and exploitation

&nbsp;✅ Step-by-Step Execution



&nbsp;1️⃣ Lab Setup

\- Registered and logged into \[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

\- Started the \*\*Virtual Attack Box\*\* provided for testing environments.

\- Accessed the IoT lab network with predefined IP addresses.



2️⃣ Reconnaissance

\- Used `nmap` to scan for open ports and services:

&nbsp; ```bash

&nbsp; nmap -sV -A 10.x.x.x
